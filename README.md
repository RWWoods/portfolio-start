# Portfolio-Start

## Description

I developed this project so that I would have a portfolio to reference professionally when I start applying for jobs in the software development field. This webpage allows me to host examples of the work I've done so far, demonstrates my competence in designing webpages, and provides easily accessible contact information for potential employers to use.


## Usage

To use the webpage, open the project in a browser. Use the links at the top to navigate the webpage, the links in the "My Work" section will eventually link to my various projects.
