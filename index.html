        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am just starting out my coding journey, as I work my way through learning HTML and JavaScript. I have always had a fascination with languages and puzzle solving, which I used in my undergraduate degree studying Latin and Ancient Greek. After working as a technician for Apple for 5 years I decided that I wanted to see if my passion for human language could merge with my love for tech. Playing around with Swift Playgrounds on iPad sparked my curiosity immediately, and I decided to take my learning further with a coding bootcamp.</p>
